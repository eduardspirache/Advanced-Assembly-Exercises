# Advanced Assembly Exercises

Advanced Assembly homework from 2nd year of university with the purpose of learning how to implement stacks, lists, advanced algorithms and recursive functions in the Assembly language.

# Exercises

1. Sorting of albums: Sorting elements in an assembly linked list, saved as a structure, with various restrictions (qSort not allowed, global variables not permitted, modifying the list's structure not permitted).

2. Implementing functions on a stack with only push and pop:
    - Least common multiple;
    - Balanced brackets;

3. Word sorting with qSort in Assembly.

4. Bank accounts - Implementing 3 mutual-recursive functions, which evaluate an expression passed as a parameter.
